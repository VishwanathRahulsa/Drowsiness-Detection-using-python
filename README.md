The Driver Drowsiness Detection System is a sophisticated safety solution  designed to mitigate the risks associated with driver fatigue and drowsiness while  operating a vehicle. This project aims to develop an intelligent system capable of  monitoring driver behavior and physiological signals in real-time, detecting signs of  drowsiness.
In an age where road safety remains a paramount concern, the advancement of 
technology offers a promising solution to mitigate one of the leading causes of accidents: 
driver drowsiness. The Driver Drowsiness Detection System stands at the forefront of this 
endeavour, promising to revolutionize the landscape of road safety by pre-emptively 
identifying and alerting drivers who are at risk of nodding off behind the wheel.
